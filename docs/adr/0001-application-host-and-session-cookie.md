# ADR 0001: The application host holds the session

Status: **Accepted** by the owner · Date: 2026-11-05

The code that makes this possible is in the PR that added this ADR, and does nothing until `APP_URL` is set. Nothing is deployed.

## Context

The MCP consent page needs a signed-in person, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` leaves open how it gets one: the gateway redirects to the application host, or the two hosts share a scoped session. It prefers host-only cookies.

## Decision

**Redirect to the application host, and keep one host-only session cookie there.** The gateway's own host never holds a person's session.

- The cookie has no `Domain` attribute, so the browser sends it to `app.podster.dev` alone. It isn't sent to `podster.dev`, `gateway.podster.dev` or any other subdomain.
- Better Auth stays in the gateway. The browser reaches it through the web Worker's `/api/auth/*`, which forwards over the service binding and passes `Set-Cookie` back. The browser only ever sees the application host, including for GitHub's and Google's callback.
- `GET gateway.podster.dev/authorize` checks the client and redirect URI, then redirects to `app.podster.dev/oauth/consent` with the same query. That page signs the person in if needed, reads the choices from the gateway and posts the decision back over the binding. The gateway still calls `completeAuthorization`, and returns the redirect to the MCP client.
- `/claim` and `/sign-in` on the gateway's host redirect the same way.
- Agents' routes are unchanged and stay on the gateway's host: `/mcp`, `/oauth/*`, Agent Auth and discovery. The web Worker refuses to forward them.

## How the gateway tells the hosts apart

`APP_URL` names the application host. A request whose URL has that origin gets Better Auth's `baseURL`, the callback URLs and the origin check for that host. Any other request gets `BASE_URL`, as now.

Public traffic for `app.podster.dev` is routed to the web Worker and can't reach the gateway, so only the service binding can send such a request. This is the one assumption to probe on staging. If that isn't enough, a named `WorkerEntrypoint`, reachable only by binding, removes the assumption at the cost of a larger gateway change.

The web Worker forwards the browser's own `Origin`. The gateway's check keeps its meaning, and each host trusts only itself.

## Alternatives

| Option | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| `Domain=podster.dev` cookie shared by both hosts | The browser would send a person's session to the landing site, the gateway and every future subdomain, so one takeover or mistake on any of them exposes it. The agent-facing host would receive session cookies it has no use for. |
| Session on the gateway's host, with the dashboard reading it there | Needs cross-site requests with credentials from the app, which means CORS and weaker `SameSite`. Server components couldn't see the cookie at all. |
| A session on each host, joined by a one-time code | Two sessions to revoke and a new code exchange to secure, with no gain over a redirect. |

## Known gap

If consent's write to the API succeeds and the directory write after it fails, a retry makes a new agent ID, leaving the first agent in the API with no credential and no directory row. Nobody can act as it, and nothing lists it. A claim doesn't have this, because its ID comes from the plugin's. Using a derived ID for consent isn't a small fix: the directory keeps a disconnected agent's row, so consenting again after a disconnect would land on the revoked agent instead of a new one.

## Consequences

- The session stays `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Lax`, with `Secure` and Better Auth's `__Secure-` prefix on HTTPS. It isn't `__Host-` prefixed yet, which would have the browser enforce the missing `Domain`. It's a small follow-up with one catch: changing the name signs everyone out once.
- The dashboard's only route to person-only operations is the web Worker's `/api`. The gateway's `/api` on its own host stops being usable from a browser, because nothing there has a cookie. It can be removed from public reach once nothing depends on it.
- Only `/api/auth/get-session` slides the session, because it's the one response whose cookie reaches the browser. Everything else reads it with `disableRefresh`, or the expiry would move on the server while the browser's cookie ran out.
- Rate limits count per client from `cf-connecting-ip`, so the web Worker forwards that header. Without it, every person would share one limit.
- Rust is unaffected. It stays private under every option.

## What was built

The code does nothing until `APP_URL` is set on the gateway.

- **Redirects.** On the gateway's host, `GET /authorize` validates the client, redirect URI, scope and PKCE, then redirects to `/oauth/consent` with the same query. A bad request gets a 400 and goes nowhere. `GET /claim` and `/sign-in` redirect too, and sign-in's `next` is translated to the application host's paths. A `POST` to `/sign-in` goes to the application host's sign-in, because finishing it here would use a callback GitHub no longer accepts. A `POST` to `/authorize` or `/claim` stays, with this host's origin check, because the journey on a deployment uses them with a session cookie it was given.
- **No session starts on the gateway's host.** With `APP_URL` set, `/api/auth/sign-in/*`, `/api/auth/sign-up/email` and `/api/auth/callback/*` answer 404 there, so a browser can't get a session on it. A cookie someone pastes in is still accepted: that host still reads sessions, it just can't issue them.
- **Read and decision.** `GET` and `POST` on `/api/consent` and `/api/claim` answer only for the application host. A decision answers with JSON naming where to send the browser, because a page's `fetch` can't follow a redirect to another host, and its CSP stops a form doing so. The consent decision must say `approve` or `decline`. There's no default.
- **`iss`.** The OAuth library takes the `iss` it sends clients from the URL it parses, so consent always parses the request as one to the gateway's host. Clients compare it with the issuer they discovered there.
- **Claim URL: `/claim?agent_id=…&code=…`.** It's the link the Agent Auth plugin already gives agents, so the redirect only changes the host. A `/claim/:token` URL would need a new stored token or a second encoding of both values, and the code would still be in the URL. Nothing there would be safer, and a person compares the code by eye anyway.

## What staging needs

Nobody has created or changed any of this.

| Thing | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hostname and route | `app-staging.podster.dev` on the `podster-web` staging Worker | Proposed name. Goes in `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` under `env.staging`. |
| Gateway var | `APP_URL=https://app-staging.podster.dev` | In `apps/gateway/wrangler.jsonc` under `env.staging`. |
| Service binding | `GATEWAY` to `podster-gateway-staging` | Already in the web config. |
| GitHub OAuth app | Callback `https://app-staging.podster.dev/api/auth/callback/github` | An OAuth app has one callback host, so sign-in on the gateway's host stops working the moment this changes. Ship it with step 1 above. |
| Secrets | None on the web Worker | It holds no signing keys or provider secrets. |

If Google sign-in is configured, its authorized redirect URI has to move to the application host too. Desktop clients are a separate limit: the gateway doesn't set `allowPrivateUseRedirectUris`, so `/oauth/register` answers 400 for a private-use redirect such as `com.example.app:/cb`, with or without `APP_URL`, and such a client never reaches `/authorize`. Loopback `http` and `https` work.

Then probe, on staging: `Set-Cookie` has no `Domain`; a real GitHub sign-in ends on the application host; sign-in, sign-up and callback on the gateway's host answer 404, and a browser that signed in on the application host sends no session cookie to the gateway's host; `cf-connecting-ip` arrives through the binding with the browser's address; a request with an `app-staging` Host header never reaches the gateway directly.
